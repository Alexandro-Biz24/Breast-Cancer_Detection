# Breast-Cancer_Detection

ðŸ©º ****Breast Cancer Detection using Deep Learning****
This project aims to detect the presence of breast cancer from medical images using a Deep Learning model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

**Project description**
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. Early detection via medical imaging can significantly increase the chances of cure. This project exploits artificial intelligence models to analyze mammograms and classify images as benign or malignant.

**Objective**: Automate breast cancer detection from images using Deep Learning to assist healthcare professionals.
